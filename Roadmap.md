## Unique Selling Points

> *What makes UDS worth $30-50*

1. **8-Band Delay Matrix** - No other plugin offers 8 independent delay lines with arbitrary routing
2. **Per-Band Algorithm Selection** - Mix Tape + Digital + Analog in one plugin
3. **Visual Routing Graph** - Modular-style patching with instant feedback
4. **Yamaha UD Stomp DNA** - Based on legendary hardware architecture

## Maintenance Protocol

### Commit Triggers (Do ALL when ANY trigger fires)

**Trigger 1: Feature Complete** - A roadmap checkbox can be marked `[x]`  
**Trigger 2: 5+ Files Changed** - Accumulated edits across multiple files  
**Trigger 3: User Requests** - User says "commit", "save", "push", etc.  
**Trigger 4: Before Risky Change** - About to refactor or delete significant code  
**Trigger 5: End of Conversation** - User says goodbye/thanks/done

**Commit Actions:**
- [ ] `git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message"`
- [ ] `git push origin main`
- [ ] Update **State.md** with current progress

### Documentation Triggers

**After completing a roadmap phase (A, B, C, D, E):**
- [ ] Update **CHANGELOG.md** with version bump
- [ ] Update **README.md** if user-facing features changed  
- [ ] Update **Architecture.md** if new classes/modules added
- [ ] Mark roadmap items `[x]` complete
- [ ] Create git tag: `git tag -a v0.X.0 -m "Phase X complete"`

### Code Hygiene Triggers

**After 3 features OR 500+ lines changed OR before major refactor:**
- [ ] Comment pass - Add/update documentation comments
- [ ] Dead code removal - Delete unused functions/variables
- [ ] Warning cleanup - Address compiler warnings  
- [ ] Test coverage - Add tests for new code paths

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 months)

- [ ] Dependency updates (JUCE, libraries)
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Memory leak check
